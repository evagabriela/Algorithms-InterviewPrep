Algorithms and Interview Prep Meetup
=====================================

This repository powers the Algorithm and Interview Prep meetup guidelines, resources and information.  

The Algorithms and Interview Prep is an event where people come to learn more about algorithms, practice whiteboarding and behavioral interview questions.  

The goal is for the attendees to learn more about algorithms and practice how to successfully approached technical interviews.

How do you run an Algorithms and Interview Prep meetup?
-------------------------------------------------------

1. Find a venue that preferably has different rooms where you can accomodate the algorithm's study group, the white boarding groups (which can be divided by different languages) and other for the behavioral or pairing programming.
2.Pick an appropriate date and time. We went for a Monday late afternoons from 6:30-9:00pm, whith free snacks or dinner provided by the host company.
3.Advertise the event.  Specify in the description what topic the Algorithm study group will cover through videos or discussions and the description of your meetup.  Here's how we advertised it:  [http://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-SF/events/168234442/]
4. Start off the event by having everyone introducing themselves if is a small group or otherwise introduce the event and the company who is hosting.  Typically companies have a representative who will share more information about the company. 
5. To kick off the event, separate the attendees by groups depending on their interest and languages for the whiteboarding. 
6. Share with the whiteboarding group, the link for optional exercises or resources that they can use to practice.  Here is a webste we developed:  [http://meetupresources.herokuapp.com/index.html]
